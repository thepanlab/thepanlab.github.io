# How to prepare label-free proteomics samples 

- Before processing， prepare the solutions first: 

  - UA: 8M urea in 0.1 M tris/HCl (pH 8.5), 1 mL per sample 

  - IAA solution: 0.05 M iodoacetamide in UA, prepare 0.1 mL per sample 

  - ABC solution: 0.05 M NH4HCO3 in water, prepare 0.25 mL per sample 

  - Note: UA and IAA solution must be freshly prepared and used within a day. 

- Processing the sample: 
~~~~
  1. Protein pellets were washed with 1 mL chilled (∼-10 °С) acetone followed by centrifugation at 20800×g for 10 min.   

  2. Protein pellets were gently disaggregated in acetone by vertexing during the first acetone addition.  
  
      After centrifugation, acetone was gently removed and discarded, and a fresh  

      1 mL of acetone was added. This acetone washing step was repeated three times.   

  3. Protein pellets were air-dried until all acetone evaporated.   

  4. Solubilized in 2 mL of guanidine buffer (6 M Guanidine HCl, 10 mM DTT in Tris CaCl2 buffer (50 mM Tris, 10mM CaCl2, pH 7.6) and incubated at 60 °С for 1 h. With intermittent vertexing to disrupt and dissolve the protein pellet.   

  5. Mix up to 30µl of a protein extract with 200µl of UA (8 M urea (Sigma, U5128) in 0.1 M Tris/HCl pH 8.5) in the filter unit (Microcon YM-30) and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min.  

  6. Add 200µlof UA to the filter unit and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min  

  7. Discard the flow-through form the collection tube.  

  8. Add 100 µl IAA solution and mix at 600 rpm in a thermo-mixer for 1 min and incubate without mixing for 20 min  

  9. Centrifuge the filter units at 14,000 x g for 10 min.  

  10. Add 100 µl of UA to the filter unit and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 15 min. Repeat this step twice.  

  11. Add 100 µl of ABC(0.05M NH4HCO3 in water) to the filter unit and centrifuge at 14,000 x g for 10 min. Repeat this step twice.  

  12. Quantify the protein by the BCA kit. 

  13. Add 40 µl ABC with trypsin (enzyme to protein ratio 1:100) and mix at 600 rpm in thermo-mixer for 1 min.  

  14. Incubate the units in a wet chamber at 37°C for 12 h  

  15. Transfer the filter units to new collection tubes.  

  16. Centrifuge the filter units at 14,000 x g for 10 min.  

  17. Add 40 µl ABC and centrifuge the filter units at 14,000 x g for 10 min.  

  18. Desalt by Pierce™ C18 Spin Columns. 

  19. Quantify the peptides concentration. 

  20. Frozen dry the samples.
