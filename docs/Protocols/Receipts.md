Medium for culture

we use modified VM medium for culturing but replacing cellobiose by 10% cellulose as the carbon source.

**Procedures:**

1. Revive the microorganisms

``= 1 \\* GB3 ①inoculate the preserved strains to respective revive medium and incubate at 34 oC until the log phase.

*Clostridium cellulolyticum*

When the OD of the culture is about 0.5(about 24 h), transfer 100µl culture to a fresh medium with the cellulose as the carbon source, incubate until the log phase (OD 0.5, about 48h).

*Methanospirillum Hungatei*

When the medium is obviously turbid, and the methane production can be detected in the headspace (about 72h)

*Methanosaeta concilii*

When the medium is obviously turbid, and the methane production can be detected in the headspace (about 1 month)

1. Inoculation 

All cultures were started using the approximately same number of cells from each included active species, so count the cell number with the flow cytometer to determine the volume of inoculation of each microorganism.

2. cultivation

After inoculation, all cultures are cultivated at 34 oC with shaking(200rpm)

every 24h, replace the 10%culture with the fresh medium, adjust pH around 7.3, remove the gas from bottle to keep the pressure at 1atm.
