### Additional Coursework
> 
> - Beyond the required 18 credit hours (6 courses) a minijmum of 27 to a max of 42 semester hours of additional graduate coursework is necessary beyond the B.S.
> - Total credit hours: 90 or more hours after B.S.
> - At least 30 hours and a maximum of 45 hours of dissertation research (CS 6980).
> - All courses must be taken for graduate credit (“G” prefix in the general catalog, no 3000 level courses or lower).
> - All PhD coursework must be taken within 6 years of admission to the Graduate College.
> - Count no more than 12 credit hours in CS G4xxx level courses.
> - At most 3 hours of independent studies (CS 5990) can be counted toward the minimum 27 hours of coursework.
> - External courses and transfer credit must be approved by the advisory committee.
> - No more than 6 credit hours in CS 5970 courses will be permitted, even with change of subject.
> - Maintain continuous enrollment of at least 2 credit hours of CS 6980 (Research for Doctoral Dissertation) after initial enrollment.
> - Attend at least 5 seminars/conferences through the duration of the program. 
>
> Timing Note: earliest initial enrollment of CS 6980 is during the semester in which the General Examination is taken.

## ACR
>
> Follow this [link] (https://www.ou.edu/gradcollege/forms) to find the official OU ACR form which is to be submitted through the OU Graduate College's online portal. After submitting the ACR to the graduate college, it should be approved by the graduate college, CS liason, and your committee members. As of recent (~2020), there is no official meeting required with the committee, but a meeting is recommended so you can get know your committee members who will play a role in determining your fate as a doctoral candidate. 
>
> The ACR should be completed ASAP, but there is no deadline. It is suggested that the ACR form is completed by the end of your first year in the doctoral program. 

## General Exam
>
> The general exam should be taken during/after the semester in which required coursework prescribed in advisory conference is completed. The Application for the General Exam must be submitted before any portion of the exam is held. When approved, the Graduate College will notify the Authority Report Form for the exam until you receive the Authority Report Form. Both the written and oral portions must be completed during the same semester.
