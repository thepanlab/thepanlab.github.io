# Major Projects  

### **Machine learning:**
  
- **Computer vision for biomedical imaging**

  Deep learning enables automatic analysis of many imaging modalities for disease diagnoses and surgery intervention. Endoscopic optical coherence tomography can
  be used to guide the needle placement in many needle-based surguries. In this project, we aim to develop computer vision models for automatic interpretation of 
  optical coherence tomography imaging data. Precise needle placement will improve the safety of needle-based surguries, such as epidural anesthesia and 
  percutaneous nephrostomy.

  Lab members: Paul Calle Contreras, Justin Reynolds, Chongle Pan.  
  Funding: Co-I in [1R01DK133717](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/CFJB1sFbw0O0rkY76X28nw/project-details/10501992) from NIH NIDDK.  
  Collaborator: Dr. [Qinggong Tang](http://tanglab.oucreate.com/) at OU.  
  Selected publications: [[Wang et al 2021](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33996237/)], [[Wang et al 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35103420/)] 

- **Explainable machine learning for predictive genomics**

  Many complex diseases, including cancers and diabetes, are caused by a combination of genetic factors and environmental factors. The genetic risk of an individual
  for a complex disease is determined by their genome. In this project, we aim to improve the prediction of complex disease occurance in individuals from their 
  whole genome using machine learning. Explainable neural network models are developed to ensure their predictions are trustworthy. Our model predictions will 
  enable precision preventive medicine tailored specifically for individuals based on their disease risks. 
  
  Lab members: Adrien Badré, Justin Reynolds, Chongle Pan.

### **Microbiota:**
 
- **Prebiotics and protiobics in humane gut microbiota**

  Human microbiomes play important roles in our health. While prebiotics and probiotics have been shown to improve many health outcomes, their mechanisms are
  not known. In this project, we aim to link the metabolisms of prebiotics with specific microorganisms in the gut microbiomes and characterize their interaction
  mechanisms. Our discoveries will enable the development of prebiotics and probiotics with enhanced health benefits. 

  Lab members: Jessica Arlington, Yi Xiong, Chongle Pan.  
  Collaborators: Dr. [Ryan Mueller](https://microbiology.oregonstate.edu/dr-ryan-mueller) and Dr. [Jed Friedman](https://medicine.ouhsc.edu/academic-departments/physiology/faculty/jacob-e-jed-friedman-phd)  
  Funding: PI in [5R01AT011618](https://reporter.nih.gov/search/t-5Gvs6MU0mf0CDCrsTC0Q/project-details/10463696) from NIH NCCIH and NIGMS.  
  Selected publications: [[Zhang et al 2022](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35729161/)], [[Young et al 2015](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/26077811/)]
  
 - **Parallel algorithms for proteomic stable isotope probing**

  Proteomic stable isotope probing are developed in our lab to track the flow of carbon and nitrogen from a substrate to its consumers in a complex community.
  In this project, we aim to improve Sipros to achieve more accurate detection of isotopically labeled peptides from shotgun proteomics data. Computing will be
  accelerated with GPU and provided in the clound. This will make proteomic stable isotope probing more accessible for the microbiome community.

  Lab members: Yi Xiong, Dongyu Wang, Chongle Pan.  
  Collaborators: Dr. [Xuan Guo](http://www.cse.unt.edu/~xuanguo/) at UNT.

  Selected publications: [[Li et al 2019](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31866955/)], [[Guo et al 2018](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/29028897/)]
  
  - **Characterization and modeling of environmental microbiota**  
  
  The wetland ecosystems are responsible for one third of global emission of methane, a potent greenhouse gas. The methane emission from wetlands will be 
  perturbed by climate changes, including seawater intrusion and frequent droughts. In this project, we aim to characterize and model the ecosystem-scale 
  biogeochemical fluxes in estuarine wetlands and lacustrine wetlands under climate changes. Our approaches include synthetic microbiomes, proteomic stable 
  isotope probing, integrated -omics, and computational modeling. Our deliverables are mechanistic models of wetland communities to inform 
  global Earth system models.
